# awesome-biolove-websites

A list of websites that are true demonstrations of love for some aspect of our beautiful biological world.

These pet projects capture a life (or at least many years) dedicated to understanding some subject in detail. In more detail than anywhere else. 
The websites are very authorial, they have signatures. They don't have the pasteurization of collective projects or restrictive publishing formats. No: they are a tour-de-force demonstration of creativity, talent, passion, and love for knowledge. 

One writer, one passion, one website.  

These marvelous things are often simple HTML or WordPress pages that have been up for decades. Some were made by academics, some were made by amateur scholars, but all of them are clearly _intrinsically_ motivated. 
It brings me immense joy to find a new portal like this. They are inspiring in so many ways that I found it valuable to organize them here, so I can find them later. 

They are not merely collections of posts; they are organized and built with a purpose, true one-person encyclopedias.

These are not as comprehensive as the ones in the Hall of Fame, but are still worth mentioning. They show passion and dedication, and are also often the best resource for a particular niche theme on the web.
